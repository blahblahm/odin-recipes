        <h3>Kofta Kebabs</h3>
        <p>I'm excited to share what is one of my all-time favorite things to grill. This is perfect for those times when you want to take a break from grilling burgers, but you also kinda want a grilled burger, since this is basically a Mediterranean-style meatball on a stick. I know "shish" gets more love, but "kofta" might be the best kebab. Serve over a tomato, onion, and cucumber salad with flatbread or pita and a lemony tahini dressing.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 slice whole grain bread, toasted</li>
            <li>½ medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>⅓ cup chopped Italian parsley</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>8 ounces ground beef</li>
            <li>4 ounces ground lamb</li>
            <li>1¼ teaspoons kosher salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon ground allspice</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon paprika</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground cardamom</li>
            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
            <li>4 bamboo skewers, soaked for at least 1 hour</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut toasted bread slice into thin strips on a cutting board; cut strips across into a small dice.</li>
            <li>Place onion, parsley, and garlic on top of diced bread on the cutting board; chop until mixture resembles tabbouleh.</li>
            <li>Season beef and lamb with kosher salt, black pepper, allspice, paprika, cardamom, nutmeg, and cayenne. Add onion mixture and water. Mix and mash with your hands until well combined.</li>
            <li>Wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate until chilled, at least 1 hour, up to overnight.</li>
            <li>Remove meat from the refrigerator and roll ¼ of the mixture into a ball using wet hands. Pierce in the middle with a bamboo skewer. Shape meat into a uniform log, about 6 inches long and 2 inches wide.</li>
            <li>Meanwhile, preheat a charcoal grill until coals are very hot.</li>
            <li>Place kebabs on the hot grill until browned and cooked through, about 12 minutes, turning every 3 minutes or so. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a kebab should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Serve.</li>
        </ol>
